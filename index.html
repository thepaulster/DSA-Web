      Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every
      enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. Data structures have gained
      significant importance because of their usage in several disciplines. Data structures are integral part of modern
      operating systems, compilers, database Management systems, data communications and so on<br><br>

      Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to
      get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm
      can be implemented in more than one programming language.<br><br><br>


      Examples of data structure include Arrays, stack, queues, linked lists, hash tables e.t.c which are used to store
      data in an organized way such that it can be used efficiently.<br>

      Examples of algorithms may include searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, divide and conquer, back tracking,
      greedy algorithms e.t.c which can operate on the data structures in order to produce results.<br>

      Algorithms together with data structures have wide spread use in several applications. These include: image
      processing, digital signal processing, simulation, numerical computations, cryptography, data compressions and
      genetic studies.<br>

      This means that data structure and algorithms are closely related. The data structure you choose directly affect
      the algorithm that will be used and vice versa<br>

      Understanding data structures and algorithms might seem unnecessary in an age where you'll be using library
      functions for 90% of your coding. Why then should you bother to learn the implementation, when the implementation
      is hidden from you behind an abstraction?<br>

      You must learn data structures and algorithms, so that you understand the logic behind the behaviour of these
      abstractions. If you don't, you will eventually apply them in a way that will hurt you.<br>

      Understanding algorithms lets you understand the problems those algorithms were built to overcome. That
      understanding will help you immensely in your dat-to-day Work, because those problems are basic logic and
      computer science problems that pop up everywhere, no matter if you're working on business software, hardware
      drivers, games or mobile apps.<br>

      We also need to tell why certain algorithms that do solve similar/same problem may be better than the other in
      terms of speed and space utilization<br>

      In simple terms programs are comprised of two things: data and algorithms. The algorithms describe the way the
      data is to be transformed. The reason for learning about data structures is because adding structure to our data
      can make the algorithms much simpler, easier to maintain, and often faster.
